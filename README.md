If you want to make this first you need to have a java ide, i recoment eclipse since is the one i use and you need the arduino ide from the harware poin you also need any kind of arduino with serial usb communication as many RGB LED's neopixel, i use <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/products/1426">this ones from adafruit </a>, a ~470 ohm resistor and last if you have too many LED's you may need 5v power supply for 32 LED's you dont need one.
